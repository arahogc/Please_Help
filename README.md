# Please_Help
A place to upload code which I am having issues with and ask for help from the class 

Current issue: 

Working on 13.2 and at the simple map part. I can't see the map at all, and I'm not getting any errors. Updated code with the snippet that John slacked out thinking that would help. That is still not helping. Uploaded a copy of the code that I have so far as well as a screenshot to show what I'm seeing. There are some console.logs in the logic.js file to just to make sure that all functions are being called/working correctly.
